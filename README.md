# ChaterixProject
Final year colleg project, utilizes Node.js, Express Framework, Jade, nginx PHP, JS. Project is Inactive.

This was my final year project in college. It consisted of:

Website [Node.js, Express.js, Socket.io, Jade, nginx] 
Android App: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=als.chaterix

Upon signing up - user creates their own avatar using pre-defined available choices (Character, Hair, Eyes, Mouth Expression, Shirt, Trousers, Shoes), 
then user can send messages to other users or enter live-chat which was built on Node.js and Socket.io where user could see other users online and message them privately as well.

Project is inactive and is not deployed anywhere, in order to deploy it - it requires server configured with nginx running on port 8080 and node.js running on port 3000.
